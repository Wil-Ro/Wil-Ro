### Hey! Welcome to my Github :)

I'm Ro, an aspiring software developer currently spending a gap year interning as a software developer in test and using my spare time to work through projects, teaching myself various languages and skills.

My interests generally lie in XR and BCI but I also spend time working on games, web-apps and creating music through code using Sonic-Pi.
