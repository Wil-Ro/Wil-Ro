##Hey! Welcome to my Github

I'm Ro, an aspiring software developer currently spending a gap year working as a waitress and using my spare time to work through projects, teach myself C++ and create VR demos and games every now and again.

I've got a bit on an obsession with AR and VR and I've always got some sort of XR related project on the burner, at the moment my main one is an open source project run by a number of people called "AardvarkXr", its a framework to allow users to easily create small programs known as "gadgets" which are written in typescript react and can be rendered in 3D over the top of a VR users view allowing for neat tools that you can just open up and use in any VR setting.

As well as this I often work on games and small tools with friends, such as a tower defense game or a team organisation website very similar to 'Trello'
