### Hey! Welcome to my Github :)

I'm Rosia, an aspiring software developer currently living as a computer science student at a small university in Wales and using my spare time to work through projects, teaching myself various languages and skills.

My interests generally lie in XR and BCI but I also spend time working on games, web-apps and creating music through code using Sonic-Pi.
