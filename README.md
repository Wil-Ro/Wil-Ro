### Hey! Welcome to my Github :)

I'm Rosia, an aspiring software developer currently living as a student at a small university in Wales studying robotics and ai and using my spare time to work through projects, teaching myself various languages and skills. 

At the moment I'm trying to learn to write somewhat low-level code that runs without too many frills or external dependencies in such a way that it can run on low power computers. My main two projects at the moment are a small rpi based laptop with an E-ink screen that fits in a 20x20cm space and a plant watering system.

My interests generally lie in environmentalism and electronics but I also find old computers and low level programming really interesting along with using code artistically such as creating music through code using Sonic-Pi. I've also previously been very interested in VR/AR so alot of my older work revolves around those concepts.

I have experience with C++, C#, Java and Python and but a have a bit of experience with Typescript/CSS/HTML/Javascript and C along with a few game engines. Though my favourite language is C++.
