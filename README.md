### Hey! Welcome to my Github :)

I'm Rosia, an aspiring software developer currently living as a computer science student at a small university in Wales and using my spare time to work through projects, teaching myself various languages and skills. 

At the moment I'm trying to learn to write somewhat low-level code that runs without too many frills or external dependancies in such a way that it can run on low power computers. My main two projects at the moment are a small rpi based laptop with an E-ink screen that fits in a 20x20cm space and a rebuild of my website with the backend programmed in C++.

My interests generally lie in environmentalism and electronics but I also find old computers and low level programming really interesting along with using code artistically such as creating music through code using Sonic-Pi. I've also previously been very interested in VR/AR and BCI's so alot of my older work revolves around those concepts.

I have previous experience with C++, C#, Typescript, Python and CSS/HTML/Javascript along with a few game engines.
